# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
LEP issues in Data Science (Assignment 2)

Background
There are approximately 500,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed globally and kills about 300,000 women each year. Early detection and treatment significantly the chances of long-term survival. Accordingly, with advances in screening technologies the number of women succumbing to this disease has steadily decreased in recent years. However, detection of the early stage cervical cancer remains a challenge. We have explored the possibility of utilizing several machine learning classifiersLinks to an external site. to identify individuals with cervical cancer based on a data set of clinical data for a cohort of 858 patients.

Age
Cervical cancer diagnoses occur predominately in women between the ages of 35 and 54 years (50%) with 20% for those aged over 65 and 15% for younger women (20-30 years). Women youger than 20 rarely develop cervical cancer however they can become infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV) which increases their chances of developing this disease later in life.
Sexual Activity

The human papilloma virus (HPV), which is sexually transmitted, is a major risk factor in developing cervical cancer. Studeies have shown that women wo have taken oral contraceptives for longer than 5-10 years appear to have a higher risk of HPV infection. Other STDs have also been associated with a high risk of developing cervical cancer.

Oral Contraceptives

Previous studies have suggested a strong correlation between the long term use of oral contraceptives and cervical cance3r.

Pregnancies

Women who have had a number of children have also been shown to have an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. Particularly for those women infected with HPV.

Smoking

Smoking has been shown to be associated with a higher risk for precancerous changes (dysplasia) in the cervix and subsequent prgression to cancer, especially for those infected with HPV.
